# Numerical Introductory Seminar 2018

## Getting started with Python
To run the `Python` code from this repository you may need to install additional modules. You can do this by opening a terminal (`CTRL-ALT-T` on `Linux` or `MacOS`) or a command line (on `Windows` just push `HOME` and start typing `run`, you should see a black icon).

First you want to change into your directory:
```
cd __path_to_your_cloned_repository__
```
Next you want to install the packages from the `requirements.txt`-file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thats all. After that you can run the python scripts by running:
```
python __name_of_script__.py
```
Note that this might be different if you are using `IDE`'s like `PyCharm`, `IDLE`, `Spyder`, etc.
